# CSS_FinalAsignment

This is my final assignment project for 5 credit course on HTML/CSS.
It is a web site for booking a vacation home at imaginary company called
Holiday Homes.

Website consists of front page (index), menu, search page, contact page and What is Holiday Homes -page.

Github repository contains also Holiday Homes -logo in different versions.
Logo was designed by me using Figma.

All contents and theme are designed by me, mainly by using Figma.

Page can be viewed in broswer through belov link:

Assignment was graded by teacher as 92 points of out 100 (UI Design, 
page implementation and techniques, responsive behavior, publishing, 
file and code conventions).

This is a demo of the very first outcomes of my learning progress, and thus 
the outcome isn't exactly as technically throurough or visually aesthetic 
as what I see as a good example to be submited to an actual client.
But it's a start!
