# CSS_FinalAsignment

This is my final assignment project for 5 credit course on HTML/CSS.
It is a web site for booking a vacation home at imaginary company called
Holiday Homes.

Assignment was graded by teacher as 92 points of out 100 (UI Design, 
page implementation and techniques, responsive behavior, publishing, 
file and code conventions).

This is demo of the very first outcomes of my learning progress, and thus 
the outcome isn't exactly as tidy as what I see as a good example
to be submited to an actual client.
